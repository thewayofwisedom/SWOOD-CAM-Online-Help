      <p>The SWOOD License and Subscription Service Agreement constitutes a legal agreement (hereafter “Agreement”) between you (either an individual or an entity) (hereafter <b>“<span>End User</span>”</b>) and <span><strong>Enseignement et Formation Informatique Computer Assisted Drawing</strong></span>, a French SARL company registered under the VAT number FR62950408765, with its principal place of business located at 55 avenue de Melgueil, 34280 La Grande Motte, France (hereafter “EFICAD”) regarding the use of EFICAD’s computer software line dedicated to woodworking and known as SWOOD®, which may include, without limitation, SWOOD Design and SWOOD CAM and other software licensed by EFICAD (hereafter “Software”). The term “Software” also includes any updates or upgrades to the Software that the End User may receive from time to time under a subscription service or other support arrangement. The End User may not download, install, use, or copy the Software on any computer without a license from EFICAD and should carefully read the Agreement PRIOR to opening the media that contains the Software, downloading or installing and using the Software. By downloading, installing or otherwise using the Software, the End User expressly acknowledges and agrees to be bound to the terms of this Agreement. If the End User does not agree to this Agreement, the media containing the Software and the accompanying items (including all written material) must promptly be returned to the place of purchase within thirty (30) days for a refund, or the End user may not download, install or use the Software. EFICAD licenses and the use of the Software are governed by this Agreement. EFICAD remains the sole owner of the Software and does not sell its ownership to the End User.</p>

      <p class="Signet">1. Grant of License</p>
      <p>Upon the End User’s acceptance to abide by this Agreement AND payment of the relevant license fee, EFICAD hereby grants a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, license to use the Software in accordance with this Agreement. If only one license was paid for, only this copy of the Software may be used on any single computer. If the End User changes computer, he must move the license from the old computer to the new/upgraded computer. However, if a network license version (hereafter “SNL”) was paid for, then the End User may have as many copies in use as were paid for and licensed. An SNL version of the Software must be installed to assure that the number of concurrent users of the Software does not exceed the number of licenses paid. The Software is considered “in use” on a computer when it is loaded into the temporary memory (e.g. RAM). Regardless of server location, the End User must always continue to comply with U.S. and U.K. export control laws.</p>

      <p class="Signet">2. Ownership of the Software</p>
      <p>EFICAD owns and will retain all copyright, trademark, trade secret and other proprietary rights in and to the Software and the Documentation, which are protected by copyright laws and other intellectual property laws. The End User obtains only such rights as are specifically provided in this Agreement, and may not remove from the Software or Documentation any copyright or other proprietary rights notice or any disclaimer, and shall reproduce all such notices and disclaimers on all copies of the Software made in accordance with this Agreement. EFICAD and its affiliated companies take all legal steps to eliminate piracy of their software products. Therefore, the Software may include a security mechanism to detect the installation or use of illegal copies of the Software as well as collect and transmit data about those illegal copies. The data collected will not include any End User data created with the Software but may be personally identifiable data. By using the Software, the End User consents to such detection, collection and transmission of data. EFICAD reserves the right to use technical protection measures (hereafter “TPM”) to protect the integrity and intellectual property rights of its Software. The End User may not take any steps to avoid or defeat the purpose of any such TPM. Any personally identifiable data collected as part of such TPM will be used solely to help enforce compliance with this Agreement and will not be used for sales or marketing purposes. By accepting this license the End User also represents that he or she has read, acknowledged and accepted the terms of our Privacy Policy and Website Terms of Use which can be found at<span> </span><a href="PRIVACY_POLICY.htm">Privacy policy</a>.</p>

      <p class="Signet">3. Other Restrictions on Use</p>
      <p>The End User shall not use the Software, other than for normal business purposes and shall not provide to any third party use of or access to the Software. Consequently the End User may not sell, license, sublicense, transfer, assign, lease or rent (including via a timeshare arrangement), modify, make derivative works, analyse for competitive purposes against EFICAD, nor proceed to reverse engineering, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Software as it contains trade secrets of EFICAD and its licensors. If the Software is provided for demonstration and evaluation purposes, it may be used by the End User for no longer than thirty (30) days (or such longer period authorised by EFICAD in writing), in order to determine if the End User wants to purchase the Software or not.</p>

      <p>The End User shall be entitled to receive maintenance services upon the purchase of a subscription for the Software which has been licensed hereunder by paying a fee. The End User will therefore be entitled to receive for such copy, and for the duration of the subscription for which he has paid: (1) access to the latest updates to the Software; (2) all major upgrades for the Software released during the subscription period; and (3) telephone support services (a) from the Authorised EFICAD Reseller from whom the subscription was purchased, or (b) from EFICAD if the subscription was purchased directly from them. It may be renewed thereafter by paying the appropriate renewal fee and must replace the previous version since no additional license is granted; the End User may install only such number of updates as equal to the number of subscriptions for which he has paid.</p>

      <p>In the event of the breach of this Agreement, and if the violation is curable but not cured within fifteen (15) days’ written notice to the End User, any license will be immediately terminated by EFICAD. Consequently, the End User must cease the use of the Software and promptly destroy or return all copies of the Software and Documentation to EFICAD. The provisions of Articles 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9 of this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.</p>

      <p>The Software and Documentation, including all software and technical data are subject to United-States or United Kingdom export controls laws and may be subject to import or export controls in other countries. The End User agrees to strictly comply with all applicable import and export regulations, and specifically agrees to not disclose or directly or indirectly export, or re-export the Software or the Documentation or any part thereof, i.e., move the Software or the Documentation from the country in which it was first licensed, without the appropriate United States or foreign government licenses and written approval of EFICAD and its licensors. Pursuant to the United-States or United Kingdom export laws, the End User represents and warrants that he is not a citizen of, or located within, an embargoed or otherwise restricted nation (including without limitation, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) and that he is therefore allowed to receive and use the Software.
